# Website Builder Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Non-blocking UI Interaction in Edit Mode

- **Problem**: The full overlay approach was blocking user interaction with website elements (buttons, menu links)
- **Solution**:
  - Replaced full overlay with a small floating edit button in the corner of each section
  - Made the section border indicator non-interactive (pointer-events: none)
  - Allows users to navigate and use the website normally while in edit mode

### 2. Direct Logo Editing

- **Problem**: Logo wasn't directly clickable for editing and used a section wrapper
- **Solution**:
  - Made logo directly clickable with a dedicated click handler
  - Added visual indicator (tooltip and cursor change) to show it's editable
  - Emits the correct path to update header.logoUrl when clicked

### 3. Hero Background Image

- **Problem**: Background image wasn't displaying correctly in hero section
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed ngStyle implementation to properly set background properties
  - Added fallback image if none specified
  - Ensured proper styling with background-size and position

### 4. Business Type Theme Selection

- **Problem**: When changing business types, theme options weren't updating correctly
- **Solution**:
  - Added theme cache clearing when business type changes
  - Improved ThemeService to skip browser caching with appropriate headers
  - Created unique mock themes for each business type for better testing
  - Fixed logic to properly select themes based on both business type and plan

## Implementation Details

### Section Hover Wrapper

- Redesigned to use a non-blocking approach with corner edit button
- Section border indicator shows active section without blocking clicks
- Preserves high z-index for the edit button only, not the entire overlay

### Direct Logo Editing

- Used direct click event handler instead of wrapper component
- Visual hover effect shows editability without blocking logo display
- Simplified HTML structure for cleaner templates

### Theme Service Enhancements

- Added no-cache headers to prevent browser caching
- Created detailed mock theme data for different business types
- Implemented proper filtering logic for business type and plan combinations

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Users can interact with the website while in edit mode
2. **Better Discoverability**: Direct logo editing is more intuitive
3. **Visual Consistency**: Hero background images display correctly
4. **Reliable Theme Selection**: Changing business types shows appropriate themes

## Future Considerations

1. **Optimize Event Handling**: Consider delegating events for better performance
2. **Refine Visual Indicators**: Ensure all editable elements have clear indicators
3. **API Integration**: Prepare for proper backend integration with better error handling
4. **Caching Strategy**: Implement a more sophisticated caching approach for production
