# Recent Improvements Summary - Webcraft Auto Website Builder

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements, fixes, and enhancements made to the Webcraft application to ensure a clean, maintainable, and high-quality codebase.

## âœ… Critical Issue Resolved: Menu Data Persistence

### Problem

Menu data was saving correctly but showing default values during template editing, causing a broken user experience for restaurant business types.

### Root Cause

The `ImageService.cleanMalformedObjectIds()` method was converting arrays to objects using the spread operator, which transformed menu categories from `[{...}, {...}]` to `{"0": {...}, "1": {...}}`.

### Solution Applied

1. **Enhanced ImageService Array Handling**: Fixed the `cleanMalformedObjectIds()` method to properly preserve array structures during data processing.
2. **Menu Section Component Refactoring**: Converted from race-condition prone method-based rendering to computed signal-based reactive updates.
3. **Comprehensive Data Validation**: Added proper type checking and fallback mechanisms.

### Files Modified

- `src/app/core/services/shared/image/image.service.ts`
- `src/app/pages/preview/standard-structure/home-standard/components/menu-section/menu-section.component.ts`
- `src/app/pages/preview/standard-structure/home-standard/components/menu-section/menu-section.component.html`

### Impact

- âœ… Menu data now persists correctly between save and edit operations
- âœ… Eliminated race conditions in component rendering
- âœ… Improved overall data integrity throughout the application
- âœ… Enhanced user experience for restaurant business types

## âœ… Footer Logo Enhancements

### Problem

Large images uploaded by customers could disrupt footer layout and create visual inconsistencies.

### Solution Applied

Enhanced footer logo sizing constraints with comprehensive image handling:

```scss
.footer-logo {
  // Enhanced size constraints to handle large customer uploads
  max-height: 40px; // Fixed standard height for all logos
  max-width: 100%;
  min-height: 20px; // Minimum height to prevent too small logos
  object-fit: contain; // Maintain aspect ratio within fixed height
  object-position: center; // Center the logo within its container
  overflow: hidden; // Prevent image overflow
  border-radius: 2px; // Subtle rounding for better appearance
}
```

### Plan-Specific Enhancements

- **Standard Plan**: max-height: 55px, max-width: 180px
- **Premium Plan**: max-height: 70px, max-width: 250px
- **Mobile**: Responsive scaling with maintained constraints

### Files Modified

- `src/app/pages/preview/components/structure-footer/structure-footer.component.scss`

### Impact

- âœ… Footer logos now scale consistently regardless of uploaded image size
