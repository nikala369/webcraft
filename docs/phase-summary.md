# Backend Integration Phase Summary

## Implemented Core Services

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive suite of services to integrate the Angular frontend with the Java Spring Boot backend:

1. **Template Services:**

   - `TemplateService`: For fetching master templates, types, and plans
   - `UserTemplateService`: For saving and managing user template customizations

2. **Build & Publishing Services:**

   - `UserBuildService`: For creating, publishing, and monitoring website builds
   - `SubscriptionService`: For managing subscription plans for website publishing

3. **Authentication Integration:**
   - Enhanced the existing `AuthService` to work with the user template and build flows
   - Added token validation and session restoration

## Key Features Implemented

- **Template Selection Flow:** Users can browse and select templates filtered by business type and plan
- **Template Customization Storage:** User customizations are saved to the backend via the API
- **Website Publishing:** Complete flow from creating a build to monitoring status and getting the published URL
- **Attachment Handling:** Foundation for handling image and video uploads via the attachment API
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling throughout all API integrations
- **Plan Management:** Proper mapping between frontend and backend plan terminology

## Code Structure Improvements

- **Service Modularity:** Each service is focused on a specific domain (templates, builds, subscriptions)
- **Interface Definitions:** Clear interface definitions for all API request/response models
- **RxJS Integration:** Proper use of RxJS operators for API calls and error handling
- **Signal Integration:** Seamless integration between Angular Signals and backend services

## Documentation Updates

- **README:** Updated with backend integration details
- **Backend Integration Guide:** New comprehensive guide for future development
- **API Documentation:** Clear documentation of all API endpoints and their usage

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced File Management:**

   - Implement proper file upload for large media files
   - Replace data URLs with backend file references

2. **User Template Management UI:**

   - Add UI for browsing saved templates
   - Implement template deletion and duplication

3. **Build Management UI:**

   - Add UI for viewing build history
   - Implement build status monitoring interface

4. **Advanced Publishing Features:**

   - Custom domain management
   - SSL certificate handling

5. **Offline Support:**
   - Implement offline editing with synchronization when online

The backend integration phase has established a solid foundation for the complete end-to-end flow from template selection to website publishing, enabling the application to store and manage user data securely in the backend.
