# Website Builder Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Component Interaction in Edit Mode**

   - Fixed the section hover overlay to allow interaction with content while in edit mode
   - Made overlay pointer-events only active when hovering, allowing button clicks and navigation
   - Ensured the website remains functional during the editing process

2. **Plan-Based Color Management**

   - Implemented ThemeColorsService to centralize color management
   - Updated BuildSteps component to use correct colors based on plan (standard vs premium)
   - Fixed dropdown styles to use CSS variables for consistent color application
   - Standardized on #4a8dff for standard plan and #9e6aff for premium plan

3. **Theme Switcher Filtering**

   - Corrected theme filtering logic to properly separate standard and premium themes
   - Removed standard themes from premium array in mock data
   - Enhanced theme service integration with proper error handling

4. **Logo Editability in Fullscreen Mode**

   - Added nested section-hover-wrapper for the logo to make it independently editable
   - Implemented higher z-index to ensure logo editor appears on top
   - Linked to header.logoUrl path for proper data binding

5. **Business Type Section Rendering**
   - Improved section rendering with shouldDisplaySection method
   - Ensured only relevant sections for each business type are displayed
   - Simplified template code for better maintainability

## Architecture Improvements

1. **Component Modularity**

   - Enhanced SectionHoverWrapper with proper input/output properties
   - Implemented both legacy and modern patterns for backward compatibility
   - Simplified code structure for better maintainability

2. **CSS Variables for Theming**

   - Implemented CSS variables for consistent styling
   - Added plan-specific color application
   - Created a more maintainable theming system

3. **Service-Based State Management**
   - Moved color management to a dedicated service
   - Improved theme service integration
   - Reduced prop drilling and duplicate code

## Next Steps

1. **Complete UI Testing**

   - Thoroughly test all edit flows in both standard and premium plans
   - Verify business type section rendering for all types
   - Ensure theme switching works correctly

2. **Further Component Refactoring**

   - Continue breaking down large components
   - Extract common patterns into reusable components
   - Improve type safety with stronger interfaces

3. **API Integration**

   - Prepare for backend integration with resilient fallbacks
   - Implement proper data models for server communication
   - Add error handling for API failures

4. **Performance Optimization**

   - Add OnPush change detection to components
   - Implement lazy loading for sections
   - Optimize rendering and state management

5. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Add JSDoc comments to key methods
   - Create developer documentation for the component system
   - Document theming system and color management
